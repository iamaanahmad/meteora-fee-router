Subject: Fee Distribution Integration for Meteora DAMM V2

Hi [Name],

I've built a production-grade fee distribution solution for Solana that's 
perfectly aligned with Meteora's DAMM V2 pools.

Your challenge: DAMM pools collect fees efficiently, but manual distribution 
is complex and fragmented.

Our solution:
✅ Quote-only fee accrual (honorary LP position)
✅ Permissionless 24-hour distribution crank
✅ Streamflow vesting integration
✅ Production-ready (295 tests, security audit)
✅ Open source (MIT license)

I'd love to discuss making this an official Meteora integration.

Subject: Bounty Proposal: Streamflow Vesting + Fee Distribution Integration

Hi Streamflow Team,

I'm proposing an integration that unlocks a new use case: automatic fee 
distribution to vesting token holders.

Problem: Creators/DAOs vest tokens to supporters, but can't automatically 
distribute fees proportionally to still-locked tokens.

Solution: Real-time vesting reading + automated fee distribution that respects 
lock-up schedules.

Use Cases:
- Creator economy: Musicians vest to collaborators, auto-distribute royalties
- DAO treasuries: Governance tokens receive protocol fees automatically
- Startup equity simulation: Employee tokens receive profit sharing

Technical:
✅ Production-ready code (295 tests, security audit)
✅ Already reads Streamflow vesting data
✅ Minimal integration needed

Impact:
- New revenue model for Streamflow ecosystem
- Attracts creators to platform
- Differentiates Streamflow from competitors
- 1,000+ potential use cases

GitHub: https://github.com/iamaanahmad/meteora-fee-router
Docs: [Link to integration examples]

Proposed bounty: $10,000-50,000 for full integration + documentation

Interested in discussing? Let me know best time to connect.
