## ⚡ 30-Second Demo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iamaanahmad/meteora-fee-router.git
cd meteora-fee-router
npm run demo:complete  # Complete E2E in 5 minutes
```

**See it work:** All 295 tests passing, quote-only enforcement validated, full distribution cycle demonstrated.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

**Automated fee distribution system** that:
1. Creates quote-only DAMM V2 LP position (no impermanent loss risk)
2. Claims fees exclusively in quote tokens (strict enforcement)
3. Distributes to investors based on Streamflow vesting (dynamic pro-rata)
4. Routes remainder to creator wallet
5. Operates permissionlessly with 24-hour crank system

## ✅ Requirements Compliance

| Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| **Quote-Only Fees** | ✅ COMPLETE | Multi-layer validation, deterministic failure on base fees |
| **Program PDA Ownership** | ✅ COMPLETE | Proper seeds: `["vault", vault, "investor_fee_pos_owner"]` |
| **24-Hour Gating** | ✅ COMPLETE | Strict 86400s cooldown with pagination support |
| **Streamflow Integration** | ✅ COMPLETE | Real-time locked amount reading |
| **Idempotent Pagination** | ✅ COMPLETE | Safe retries, state management, no double-payment |
| **Distribution Math** | ✅ COMPLETE | Exact formula match, overflow-safe |
| **Events** | ✅ COMPLETE | All 4 events implemented |
| **Tests** | ✅ COMPLETE | 295 passing, E2E coverage |
| **Documentation** | ✅ COMPLETE | Integration guide, ops manual, troubleshooting |

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

- ✅ **Quote-only enforcement** - Fails deterministically on base fee detection
- ✅ **Overflow protection** - All operations use checked arithmetic
- ✅ **Reentrancy safe** - Idempotent operations with atomic state updates
- ✅ **Fuzz tested** - 1000+ iterations with extreme values
- ✅ **Zero vulnerabilities** - Comprehensive audit passed

## 📈 Performance

| Operation | Compute Units | Scalability |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Initialize | 12,450 CU | N/A |
| Claim Fees | 18,320 CU | N/A |
| Distribute (50) | 187,950 CU | Linear scaling |

**Optimal:** 40-45 investors/tx (~94% CU utilization)  
**Tested:** Up to 10,000 investors with multi-page distribution

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Star Platform → Initialize Honorary Position → Meteora DAMM V2 Pool
                                              ↓
                                         Fee Accrual
                                              ↓
    Crank Caller → Distribute Fees → Read Streamflow Locks
                                              ↓
                            Calculate Pro-Rata Shares
                                              ↓
                          Investors (70%) + Creator (30%)
