# 🔒 Security Policy

## 🛡️ Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Meteora Fee Router team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### 📞 How to Report

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use one of these secure channels:

1. **GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred)
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/iamaanahmad/meteora-fee-routing-anchor/security/advisories)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the private vulnerability report form

2. **Email** (Alternative)
   - Send details to: **[INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]**
   - Use GPG encryption if possible
   - Include "SECURITY" in the subject line

### 📋 What to Include

Please provide the following information in your report:

- **Vulnerability type** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept** or exploit code (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### 🚀 Response Timeline

We will acknowledge receipt of vulnerability reports within **48 hours** and strive to:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed and users have time to update

## 🎯 Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | ✅ Fully supported |
| 0.9.x   | ⚠️ Critical fixes only |
| < 0.9   | ❌ No longer supported |

## 🔍 Security Measures

### 🛠️ Development Security

- **Code Review**: All changes require peer review
- **Automated Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with security tests
- **Static Analysis**: Regular code analysis for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular audits of third-party dependencies

### 🏗️ Architecture Security

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimal permission grants
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Overflow Protection**: Safe arithmetic operations
- **Access Controls**: Proper authentication and authorization
- **State Management**: Secure state transitions

### 🧪 Testing Security

- **Fuzz Testing**: Random input testing for edge cases
- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Audit Tests**: Comprehensive security audit test suite
- **Edge Case Testing**: Extreme value and boundary testing

## 🚨 Known Security Considerations

### ⚡ High-Risk Areas

1. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Overflow/underflow protection in place
   - Extreme value handling tested
   - Safe math operations enforced

2. **Access Controls**
   - Role-based permissions implemented
   - Authority validation required
   - State modification protections

3. **External Integrations**
   - Streamflow integration secured
   - Input validation for external data
   - Error handling for external failures

### 🔧 Mitigation Strategies

- **Batch Processing**: Limits on batch sizes to prevent DoS
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against excessive operations
- **State Validation**: Comprehensive state consistency checks
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes

## 🏆 Security Best Practices

### 👥 For Contributors

- **Follow secure coding practices**
- **Validate all inputs thoroughly**
- **Use safe arithmetic operations**
- **Implement proper error handling**
- **Add security-focused tests**

### 🏢 For Integrators

- **Validate all responses** from the program
- **Implement proper error handling** in your applications
- **Use the latest supported version**
- **Monitor for security updates**

### 👤 For Users

- **Keep your Solana CLI updated**
- **Verify program addresses** before interacting
- **Use reputable RPC endpoints**
- **Monitor your transactions** for unexpected behavior

## 🎖️ Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help improve our security:

### 🏅 Hall of Fame

Security researchers who have responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities will be:

- **Listed in our Security Hall of Fame** (with permission)
- **Acknowledged in release notes** for fixed vulnerabilities
- **Invited to future security discussions**
- **Eligible for bug bounty rewards** (if program is active)

### 💰 Bug Bounty Program
