## Prerequisites
1. **NPM Account**: Ensure you're logged in as `@ashqking`

3. **Tests Passing**: Verify all tests pass

## Step-by-Step Publishing

### 1. Login to NPM
```bash
npm login
# Enter credentials for @ashqking account
```

### 2. Verify Login
```bash
npm whoami
# Should return: ashqking
```

### 3. Build the Project
```bash
# Build Anchor program
anchor build

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests to ensure everything works
npm run test:unit
```

### 4. Update Version (if needed)
```bash
# Bump version automatically
npm version patch  # for 1.0.1
npm version minor  # for 1.1.0
npm version major  # for 2.0.0

# Or manually edit package.json version field
```

### 5. Publish to NPM
```bash
# Publish with public access (required for scoped packages)
npm publish --access public
```

### 6. Verify Publication
```bash
# Check if package is published
npm view @ashqking/meteora-fee-router

# Install your own package to test
npm install @ashqking/meteora-fee-router
```

## Alternative: Use the Publishing Script

# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/publish-npm.js

# Run the automated publishing script
